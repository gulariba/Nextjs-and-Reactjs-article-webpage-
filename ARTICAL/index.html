  <h1>Next.js vs React.js: A Professional Overview</h1>
</header>

<div class="container">

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    In the ever-evolving world of web development, <strong>Next.js</strong> has emerged as a robust framework built on top of <strong>React.js</strong>, providing features that enhance the development experience, such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and SEO optimization.
  </p>
  <p>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

    Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.
    
    Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.</p>
    <p>ReactJS, also known as React, is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is also referred to as a front-end JavaScript library. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. </p>

  </div>

  <h3>What is React.js?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>React.js</strong> is a popular open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook. Itâ€™s used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs). React is known for its component-based architecture and its virtual DOM, which optimizes UI rendering.
  </p>

  <h2>Next.js: The Framework that Enhances React.js</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Next.js</strong> is a React framework created by Vercel that brings additional features such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and file-based routing. These features make it ideal for building production-ready applications that are fast and SEO-friendly.

  </div>

  <h3>Key Features of React.js</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Component-Based Architecture</li>
    <li>Virtual DOM for optimized rendering</li>
    <li>Unidirectional Data Flow</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Features of Next.js</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</li>
    <li>Static Site Generation (SSG)</li>
    <li>File-Based Routing</li>
    <li>API Routes for Backend Logic</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Next.js Gained Popularity Over React.js</h2>
  <p>
    Next.js has gained popularity over React.js due to its built-in features that solve critical web performance and SEO issues. While React.js is great for client-side rendering, Next.js offers server-side and static site generation, ensuring faster load times and better SEO rankings.
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    While Next.js has enhanced the capabilities of React.js by adding server-side rendering, static site generation, and better performance optimization, React.js remains a fundamental library. Together, they offer a powerful toolset for building modern web applications.
